    "Consider the right angled triangle with sides $a=7$, $b=24$ and $c=25$.\n",
    "The area of this triangle is $84$, which is divisible by the perfect numbers $6$ and $28$.\\\n",
    "Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\\gcd(b,c)=1$.\\\n",
    "Also $c$ is a perfect square.\n",
