    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is equivalent to forming an infinite grid of triangles and finding lines between vertices in such a way that the line does not intersect any other vertex. The number of bounces is equal to the number of triangle walls the line cross.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make calculations simpler, we can construct a coordinate system such that each vertex correspond to an integer coordinate. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point in the grid corresponding to the vertex point $C$ has coordinates $(x, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(i, 3n - (x \\mod 3))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A line between $(0, 0)$ and $(x, y)$ passes through no other lattice points (vertices) if x and y are co prime. The number of intersections (bounces) with triangle walls is equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_\\mathrm{bounce} = 1 + 2(y-2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the search can be restricted to areas where $x>0$ and $y>2x$. This will miss symmetric solutions, but these can be solved by simply multiplying the number of found paths with two."
